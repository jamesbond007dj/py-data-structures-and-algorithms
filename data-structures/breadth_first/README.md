# Data Structures - Graph (Get Edge Function)

**Author**: James Bond
**Version**: 1.0.0

### Overview
Writing a function that takes a graph adding a traversal method to the Graph class created above this module. As the name states, this is a breadth first traversal method.

### Approach & Efficiency
Graph Method is used.
Big O time = O(n^2)
Big O space = O(n)

### API
Graph Class with add_node, add_edge, get_nodes, get_neigbors, get_values and breadth_first methods
