# Singly Linked List

Utulizing the single responsibility principle to a Linked List.

## Challenge

Functionality Instantiate an empty linked list
Functionality Insert into the linked list
The head property pinting to first node in the linked list
Insert multiple Nodes into linked list
Return True when finding an existing value within the linked list
Return False when a nonexisting value searched in the linked list
Return a collection of all values that exists in the linked list

## Approach & Efficiency

Insert, includes and to_string methods are used O(n) for big O time and big O
space complexities.

## API

The linked list class has an attribute head, insert adds a node to in front of head attribute and makes it new head, includes search a node whether it is in linked list or not and to_string returns a string result.
