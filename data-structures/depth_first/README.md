# depth_first
Create a method to traverses a tree in depth first order and returns a list of the values at each vertex that's visited. 
## Challenge
Write a function depth_first which starts a root and travels graph each vertexcies and recuse to each non visited vertex. 
## Approach & Efficiency
breadth_first: Time: `O(n)`   Space: `O(n)`
