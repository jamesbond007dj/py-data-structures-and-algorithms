## Stack & Queue

## Challenge
Create 3 classes one for Nodes, one for Stack and one for Queue. Create functions for Stack and Queue 1:Adds a value to Stack and Queue, 2:Pops Value from Stack and Queue 3:View value of Stack and Queue
4: Confirms Empty Stack or Queue or not.

## Approach & Efficiency
#### Stacks
Push: `O(1)`For Stack 
Pop: `O(1)`For Stack 
Peek: `O(1)` For Stack & Queue
Is Empty: `O(1)` For Stack & Queue
#### Queues
Enqueue: `O(1)`  For Queue
Dequeue: `O(1)` For Queue
Peek: `O(1)` For Stack & Queue
Is Empty: `O(1)` For Stack & Queue

## APIs
Enqueue In: `value` -> Out: `None`   For Queue
Dequeue In: `None` -> Out: `Removed Node`  For Queue
Peek In: `None` -> Out: `Show Value`  For Stack & Queue
Is Empty In: `None` -> Out: `True/False` For Stack & Queue
