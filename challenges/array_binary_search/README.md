# Challenge Summary
Write a function that takes in an array and a search key , then if search key inside the array, function returns the index number of this value. if it is not in the array, function returns -1 value.

## Challenge Description
Searching a value at an array code-challenge which is solved by using if statement with WHILE TRUE TRY EXCEPT method with Python Language and test the function with pytest.

## Approach & Efficiency
First we take an array and a key value. Then check whether there is this key value in the array, or notby using if statement with WHILE TRUE TRY EXCEPT method. If it is in the array return the index number of it. I test the function by 5 tests as an edge test I check it if there are more than same key, empty array and string objects array.
The function passes these tests.
