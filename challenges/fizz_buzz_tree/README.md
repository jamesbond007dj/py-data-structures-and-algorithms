# Fizz Buzz Tree
Create a function called fizz_buzz_tree that takes in a tree of nodes with values then the fucntion will return a new tree that the values divided by 3 will be replaced with Fizz, the values divided by 5 will be replaced with Buzz, the values divided by 3 and 5 will be replaced with FizzBuzz.

## Challenge
Make a function that takes in a binary tree of ints as a parameter and returns a tree of strings that has replaced the values based on FizzBuzz principles. I used a helper function in my function to make a tree.


## Approach & Efficiency
fizz_buzz_tree: time:O(n) and space: O(n)

## Solution
